								<h3>Systems Integration Group Project - Fall 2020</h3>
								<p>My group and I evaluated and understood the strategic direction of Disney+ at its core and documented the foundations of what drives its purpose. My team analyzed and understood the steps and holistic approach towards the development and integration of an enterprise system. The goal was to familiarize the group with both an external and internal process evaluation in order to provide a comprehensive view of all system components. Overall, we understood that the purpose of any system integration is to provide an organization with competitive advantage while leveraging the technology it already has or needs to obtain.</p>

									The group has been tasked with creating a system (procedure or set of steps that may include novel computer programs or scripts created by the group) linking "off the shelf" technologies in such a way that handwritten encoded messages (encrypted possibly using a foreign language or "made up" alphabet as the plain text original message) can be digitized and processed by automated decryption techniques (using open source or inexpensive software) in order to decrypt them. The ideal goal of the project is for a group to demonstrate a working prototype of the entire “system” (which is a set of linked procedures) taking a handwritten encrypted message, digitizing it, and then using software to decrypt it.
								</p>

								<p>My team tackled and addressed problems, such as understanding how to interpret or encode a handwritten message that may be written in a foreign language or "made up" alphabet, how to digitize the handwritten message, and how to take the digitized message rendered and link it to a series of open source or inexpensive decryption algorithims (software) in order to decipher the message.</p>

								My team of three other information science & technology students designed a new mobile application for the Penn State community. StafFish is an enhanced version of the current program, Starfish, but includes better communication tools, new calendar functionalities, and better usability. As we began the initial research, we started with the front end analysis: users, environment, tasks, and functions. Next, we created various possible personas describing the ideal users intended to use the app. Additionally, we conducted unstructured and structured interviews to learn about the current pain points of the users. Finally, we designed basic wireframes, which later developed into high fidelity prototypes.</p>
								
								<p>My role on the team was primarily in the research and design phases. Conducting research is crucial in designing a successful application. I performed various interviews to learn about the users' experiences and better understand their diverse situations. Furthermore, I solely created the high fidelity prototype using Adobe XD. I transformed the basic wireframes into a real-life application that is responsive and professional.</p>
